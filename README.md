#ðŸš€ Matrix Multiplication Using CUDA

#ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my implementation of CUDA-based matrix multiplication for the High-Performance Computing (HPC) course (CS-4110). The project includes:

CPU and GPU matrix multiplication implementation using CUDA
Performance comparison (execution time, speedup)
1D vs. 2D kernel launch configurations
Analysis of execution on different GPUs
Detailed report and graphical analysis
