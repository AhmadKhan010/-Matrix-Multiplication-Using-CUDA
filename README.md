# 🚀 Matrix Multiplication Using CUDA

# 📌 Overview
This repository contains my implementation of CUDA-based matrix multiplication for the High-Performance Computing (HPC) course (CS-4110). The project includes:

CPU and GPU matrix multiplication implementation using CUDA

Performance comparison (execution time, speedup)

1D vs. 2D kernel launch configurations

Analysis of execution on different GPUs

Detailed report and graphical analysis

📊 Performance Analysis
Key insights from the execution:
✔ Speedup Analysis: The GPU implementation significantly outperforms the CPU, especially for larger matrices.
✔ 1D vs. 2D Kernel Comparison: The 2D kernel launch is more efficient due to better memory access patterns.
✔ GPU Comparison: Running on different GPUs (local vs. Google Colab) shows notable performance differences.

🔥 Results Overview
📌 Detailed graphs can be found in the results folder.
